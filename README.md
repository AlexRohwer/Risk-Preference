# riskpreference
By applying a machine learning technique called Naive Bayes, this program attempts to evaluate a dataset  of surveys and establish a relationship between someone’s risk preference when playing the lottery and  several demographic and risk-preference variables. It also plots aspects of the data relation using  Matplotlib and numpy.
